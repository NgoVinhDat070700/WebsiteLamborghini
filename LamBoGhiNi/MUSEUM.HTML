                <p class="nd">The Lamborghini Museum has been updated to become Museum of Technologies, where fascinating history, the iconic models and tours of the production lines tell the story of over 50 years of innovation that project Lamborghini into the future.
                    <br><br> Mudetec offers an interactive experience, also thanks to the new driving simulator that amplifies the thrills and the discovery of the vehicles on display. <br> <br> From the early visionary creations of the genius of Ferruccio
                    Lamborghini like the Miura and Countach to the more recent and exclusive super sports cars like the hybrid concept Asterion, the few-off Centenario, the Huracán Performante and the Aventador SVJ. <br><br> Open every day from 9:30 a.m.
                    until 6 p.m.
